## What I Did
I'm thrilled to present my Restaurant Website project, a hands-on demonstration of my proficiency in JavaScript programming and innovative modular development techniques. With this project, I aimed to create a captivating restaurant website, predominantly powered by JavaScript modules, while keeping HTML and CSS involvement to a minimum.

Here are some key features:
1. **JavaScript-Centric Approach:** The project primarily relies on JavaScript to create an interactive and dynamic restaurant website. The goal is to demonstrate my proficiency in utilizing JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) and create a seamless user experience.

2. **Modular Development:** The website is organized into different sections, each with its own dedicated JavaScript file. This modular structure allows for better code organization, maintainability, and reusability.

3. **Minimalist HTML and CSS:** While CSS plays a crucial role in styling the website, I've intentionally kept HTML and CSS to a minimum, dedicating around 25% of the project's effort to CSS. This decision emphasizes my mastery of JavaScript's capabilities in creating dynamic content and handling user interactions.

4. **Command Line Proficiency:** Throughout the project, I've practiced using the command line for various tasks, such as managing npm packages, running scripts, and navigating my project's directory structure. This showcases my ability to work efficiently and confidently within a development environment.

## Installation & Set Up
1. You have to fork this repo first. Github has a their own [step-by-step guide with pictures to follow along](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository).
- **Note**: You have the option of changing the name of your forked repo.
2. And to have all the files locally on your computer, open Terminal -> change the current directory to the directory you want to put this forked repo. Then, enter the command line below:
```
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/restaurant_page.git
```
- **Note**: If you change the name of your forked repo, replace 'restaurant_page.git' with '[your-forked-repo-name].git'. Github will automatically do this for you when you copy the link.
3. Finally, change to your new forked repo directory.
```
cd restaurant_page
```
or
```
cd [your-forked-repo-name]
```
